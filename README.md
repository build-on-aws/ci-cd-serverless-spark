## Serverless Spark CI/CD on AWS with GitHub Actions

Sample code repo that shows how to run GitHub Actions with Amazon EMR Serverless. Forms the basis of the following tutorial:

- [Deploy Serverless Spark jobs to AWS using GitHub Actions](https://buildon.aws/tutorials/deploy-serverless-spark-jobs-to-aws-using-github-actions)

The code here represents what your repository should look like after following the tutorial.

## Pre-requisites

- An AWS Account with Admin privileges
- GitHub OIDC Provider in AWS
- S3 Bucket(s)
- EMR Serverless Spark application(s)
- IAM Roles for GitHub and EMR Serverless

You can create all of these, including some sample data, using the included [CloudFormation template](template.cfn.yaml).

> **Warning** ðŸ’° The CloudFormation template creates EMR Serverless applications that you will be charged for when integration tests **AND** the scheduled workflow runs.

> **Note** The IAM roles created in the template are _very tightly scoped_ to the relevant S3 Buckets and EMR Serverless applications created by the stack.
